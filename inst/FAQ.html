    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">This document 
    contains answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about 
    Rmetrics. For R itself we highly recommend to consult Kurt Hornik's 
    FAQ on R, availalble fromthe CRANServer. Additionally there are two 
    platform-specific FAQs about R: The R Windows FAQfor all users of 
    Microsoft operating systems, and the R MacOS X FAQfor all users of 
    Apple operating systems. Note that the latter two are complementary 
    to the general R FAQ, i.e., you should read both the general FAQ and 
    your platform-specific one.</FONT></FONT></P>

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">Rmetrics is a 
    collection of several hundreds of functions which may be useful for 
    teaching &quot;Financial Engineering&quot; and &quot;Computational 
    Finance&quot;. These functions are available for R, &#147;GNU&#146;s 
    S&#148;. This is a freely available language and environment for 
    statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of 
    statistical and graphical techniques.</FONT></FONT></P>

    What is Rmetrics?</FONT></B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">The functions 
    availalbel through Rmetrics have their source in algorithms and 
    functions written by myself, my students, and many other authors. A 
    major aim is to bring financial algorithms and concepts together 
    under a common software platform and to make it public available 
    mainly for teaching financial engineering and computational finance. 
    Rmetrics is not part of CRAN, Rmetrics is an initiative by its own. 
    Rmetrics has some aims similar like Bioconductor. Rmetrics is an open 
    source and open development software project. The basic R port from 
    which Rmetrics originated was already initiated in 1999 as an outcome 
    of lectures held by Diethelm W&uuml;rtz on topics in econophysics at 
    ETH Z&uuml;rich. Meanwhile, the family of the Rmetrics packages 
    includes four members dealing with the following subjects: fBasics - 
    Markets, Basic Statistics, Date and Time, fSeries - The Dynamical 
    Process Behind Financial Markets, fExtremes - Beyond the Sample, 
    Dealing with Extreme Values, and fOptions - The Valuation of Options. 
    Two other packages are under current development, fBonds and fPortfolio.</FONT></FONT></P>
   <P>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>What is 
    included in the fBasics Package?</I> The package fBasics covers the 
    management of economic and financial market data. Included are 
    functions to download economic indicators and financial market data 
    from the Internet. Distribution functions relevant in finance are 
    added like the asymmetric stable, the hyperbolic and the inverse 
    normal gaussian distribution function to compute densities, 
    probabilities, quantiles and random deviates. Estimators to fit the 
    distributional parameters are also available. Some additional 
    hypothesis tests for the investigation of correlations, dependencies 
    and other stylized facts of financial time series can also be found 
    in this package.</FONT></FONT></P>

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>What is 
    included in the </I></FONT></FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">fCalendar</FONT></FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2"><I> Package?</I> 
    The package fCalendar covers the managment of dates, time, and 
    calendars. The package makes available very powerful 'timeDate' and 
    'timeSeries' S4 classes. A holiday database for all ecclestial and 
    public holidays in the G7 countries and Switzerland is provided 
    together with a database of daylight saving times for financial 
    centers around the world. Special calendar management functions were 
    implemented to create easily business calendars for exchanges. A 
    collection of functions for filtering and outlier detection of high 
    frequency foreign exchange data records collected from Reuters' data 
    feed can also be found together with functions for de-volatilization 
    and de-seasonalization of the data.</FONT></FONT></P>
   <P>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>What is 
    included in the fSeries Package?</I> The package fSeries covers 
    topics from the field of financial time series analysis including 
    ARIMA, GARCH, long memory modelling, and chaotic time series analysis 
    . This library tries to bring together the content of existing 
    R-packages with additional new functionality on a common platform. 
    The collection comes with functions for simulations, parameter 
    estimation, diagnostic analysis and hypothesis testing of financial 
    time series. The tests include methods for testing unit roots, 
    independence, normality of the distribution, trend stationary, and 
    neglected non-linearities. In addition functions for testing for 
    higher serial correlations, for heteroskedasticity, for 
    autocorrelations of disturbances, for linearity, and functional 
    relations are provided. Furthermore, distribution functions for GARCH 
    modelling like the normalized Student-t and the GED together with 
    their skewed versions have been added which require for their 
    computation Heaviside and related functions. The demonstration 
    directory includes also a R-interface for the GarchOx software package.</FONT></FONT></P>

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>What is 
    included in the </I></FONT></FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">fMultivar</FONT></FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2"><I> Package?</I> 
    The package fMultivar deals mainly with multivariate aspects of time 
    series analysis. Offered are algorithms for regression analysis 
    including neural network modelling with feedforward networks. 
    Furthermore functions for sytem equation modelling are available. 
    Technical analysis and benchmarking is another major issue of this 
    package. The collection offers a set of the most common technical 
    indicators together with functions for charting and benchmark 
    measurements. For the technical analysis of markets several trading 
    functions are implemented and also tools are availalble for a rolling 
    market analysis. A matrix addon with many functions which allow an 
    easy use of matrix manipulations is also part of this package. This 
    addon includes functions to generate several kind of standard 
    matrixes, to extract subsets of a matrix, and some function from 
    linear algebra. This matrix addon is thought to be used to manipulate 
    easily the data of multivariate time series objects.</FONT></FONT></P>
   <P>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>What is 
    included in the fExtremes Package?</I> The package fExtremes covers 
    topics from the field what is known as extreme value theory. The 
    package has functions for the exploratory data analysis of extreme 
    values in insurance, economics, and finance applications. Included 
    are plot functions for empirical distributions, quantile plots, 
    graphs exploring the properties of exceedences over a threshold, 
    plots for mean/sum ratio and for the development of records. 
    Furthermore functions for preprocessing data for extreme value 
    analysis are available offering tools to separate data beyond a 
    threshold value, to compute blockwise data like block maxima, and to 
    de-cluster point process data. One major aspect of this package is to 
    bring together the content of already existing R-packages with 
    additional new functionality for financial engineers on a common 
    platform investigating fluctuations of maxima, extremes via point 
    processes, and the extremal index. A new additional chapter on risk 
    measures, stress testing and copulae is planned to be added in the 
    near future.</FONT></FONT></P>
   <P>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>What is 
    included in the fOptions Package?</I> The package fOptions covers the 
    valuation of options including topics like the basics of option 
    pricing in the framework of Black and Scholes, including almost 100 
    functions for exotic options pricing, including the Heston-Nandi 
    option pricing approach mastering stochastic volatility, and Monte 
    Carlo simulations together with generators for low discrepancy 
    sequences. Beside the Black and Scholes option pricing formulas, 
    functions to valuate other plain vanilla options on commodities and 
    futures, and function to approximate American options are also 
    available. Some binomial tree models are implemented. The exotic 
    options part comes with a large number of functions to valuate 
    multiple exercise options, multiple asset options, lookback options, 
    barrier options, binary options, Asian options, and currency 
    translated options. Some functions for the investigation of 
    exponential Brownian motion in the context of Asian option valuation 
    have been recently added.</FONT></FONT></P>

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>What is 
    included in the </I></FONT></FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">fPortfolio</FONT></FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2"><I> Package?</I> 
    The package fPortfolio covers multivariate distributions, assets 
    modelling, drawdown statistics, value-at-risk modelling, Markowitz 
    portfolios, two assets. The multivariate distribution functions allow 
    to compute multivariate densities and probabilities from skew normal 
    and skew Student-t distribution functions. Furthermore, multivariate 
    random daviates can be generated, and for multivariate data, the 
    parameters of the underlying distribution can be estimated by the 
    maximum log-likelihood estimation. The functions for assets modelling 
    can be used togenerate multivariate artficial data sets of assets, 
    which fit the parameters to a multivariate normal, skew normal, or 
    (skew) Student-t distribution. Included in the library are also 
    functions to compute some benchmark statistics. In addition a 
    function is provided which allows for the selection and clustering of 
    individual assets from portfolios using hierarchical and k-means 
    clustering approaches. Tools are provided to evaluate dtawdown 
    statistics. Availalble are functions for the density, distribution 
    function, and random number generation for the maximum drawdown 
    distribution. In addition the expectation of drawdowns for Brownian 
    motion can be computed. Value-at-Risk Modelling is another topic 
    which is consider in this library. Value-at-Risk and related risk 
    measures for a portfolio of assets can be evaluated. A group of 
    functions is dedicated to the Markowitz portfolio optimization 
    problem. Functions for the computation of the efficient frontier, for 
    the market line, for the tangency portfolio and for Monte Carlo 
    simulations are part of the library. Analytical formulas for the 
    Markowitz and for the Condition VaR Portfolio approach are implemented.</FONT></FONT></P>

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2"><I>Who are the 
    devellopers behind Rmetrics?</I> The writing of the functions which 
    are now available in Rmetrics started originally as assignments in my 
    lectures on &quot;Econophysics&quot; at the Institute of Theoretical 
    Physics at ETH Z&uuml;rich. Since in the financial community and also 
    in my lectures MS Windows is the mostly used operating system, 
    special emphasis is given to the Microsofts OS. Thus, to teach 
    financial engineers it became quite natural for me to work under 
    Windows. For a broad distribution and acceptance of Rmetrics I 
    decided to continue the devellopment primarily under Windows 2000/XP. 
    There are no many people behind Rmetrics, currently it's only me. I 
    have my job as a lecturer at the Institute of Theoretical Physics at 
    ETH Zurich, and I'm the senior partner of an ETH spin-off software 
    company, Finance Online. So I have several responsibilities to take, 
    and as a consequence things might go slow ... The growing Rmetrics 
    collection is based on many statistical and financial functions which 
    were contributed by myself, my students, or were ported from many 
    other sources during the last seven years since I started my lectures 
    in &quot;Econophysics&quot; at ETH. I'm aware that the work is by far 
    not complete. Parts of the software are still untested, and may 
    contain some bugs. Contributions are welcome!</FONT></FONT></P>

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">Rmetrics has a 
    commitment to full open source code development and distribution. All 
    contributions included in the Rmetrics packages are expected to exist 
    under an open source license such as GPL2. The reasons for this 
    commitment are the ability to test, to extend and to improve the 
    software in a convenient way, to encourage excellent scientific 
    computing and statistical practice in financial engineering and 
    computational finance, and to provide a workbench of tools that allow 
    to explore and expand the methods used to analyze financial market 
    data and to valuate financial instruments.</FONT></FONT></P>

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">All functions used 
    by Rmetrics and becoming part of the Rmetrics packages must be 
    available under a Debian conform license. R packages must be 
    availalble on the CRAN Server in Source and also in Binary form for 
    the Windows and Mac OSX operating systems. Furthermore, they must be 
    part of the (compiled) Debian distribution and the Knoppix Quantian 
    CD. For functions and packages which are not fulfilling these 
    conditions or are in conflict with other functions used in the 
    Rmetrics packages their functionality will be made available in form 
    of Builtin-Functions. These Builtin-Functions are GNU licensed 
    functions which were modified and copied to Rmetrics packages to 
    fullfill the required specifications. This is the only reason why we 
    have added Builtin functionality.</FONT></FONT></P>

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">Rmetrics and 
    Finmetrics are packages for modeling, analyzing, and visualizing 
    financial market data. Both packages offer a modern and flexible 
    environment for reliable and robust, predictive econometric modeling 
    and for valuation and pricing of financial instruments. What Rmetrics 
    is for R, is Finmetrics for S-Plus.</FONT></FONT></P>
