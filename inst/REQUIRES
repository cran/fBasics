________________________________________________________________________________
BY DEFAULT LOADED PACKAGES:

    Version R 1.9.0 claims:
    
    Package 'base' has been split into packages 'base', 'graphics',
    'stats' and 'utils'. All four are loaded in a default installation.
    We assume that this is the case.
        
    Packages 'ctest', 'eda', 'modreg', 'mva', 'nls', 'stepfun' and 'ts' 
    have been merged into 'stats', thus they are also loaded in a 
    default installation.
    We assume that this is the case.
    
    All the time series datasets have been moved to package 'stats'.  
    They are available in a default installation.
    We assume that this is the case.
    
    The package 'Sweave' has been 'moved to utils'.
    
    Package 'mle' has been moved to 'stats4' which will become the central 
    place for statistical S4 classes and methods distributed with base R. 

    
________________________________________________________________________________
NON-DEFAULT LOADED BASIC PACKAGES WHICH WEASSUME ARE AVALAIBLE:

    MASS    WE assume that MASS is availalble. Package 'lqs' has been 
            returned to 'MASS'.  
    
    methods required for S4 classes
    
    mgcv    required by fSeries for time series regression analysis
    nnet

CONTRIBUTED PACKAGES WHICH ARE PARTLY INCLUDED:

    Note, tat these packages must not be available on your machine,
    We have included the partly rquired code in the fLibraries of
    Rmetrics. Since we don't need all the code from these packages
    we have copied it to Rmetrics. This makes maintenance and 
    installation of Rmetrics on several different platform much easier!
    
    date        The tiny C program is included.
    
    evir        All R functions, data sets and help pages are 
                included.
    
    ismev       All R functions, data sets and help pages are 
                included.
    
    tseries     R functions and help pages for the time series
                tests are included 
    
    lmtest      R functions and help pages for the linear modelling
                tests are included 
    
    mda         R functions, help pages and the Fortran Code for the
                'mars' function are included
    
    polspline   R functions, help pages and the C/Fortran Code for the
                'polymars' function are included
    
    fracdiff    R functions, help pages and the Fortran Code for the
                'fracdiff' function are included.
