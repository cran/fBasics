________________________________________________________________________________
For the next Rmetrics VERSION 1091.10058


2004-10-11 Rmetrics
    The new version is now proofed to be conform witr R Version 2.0 for
    all its functions.

2004-10-03 fSeries: ArmaStatistics
    The functions from the "ArmaStatisticts" collection have been merged
    with the collection of "ArmaModelling" functions.
    
2004-10-01 Rmetrics:
    The naming of the source and manual page files follows now a unique
    naming convention.
    
2004-09-27 fSeries: demo/funSeries
    Three new functions have been added to the "funSeries.R" file in the
    demo directory: "tslag" - computes lagged or leading vector/matrix 
    of selected order(s), "pdl" - creates a regressor matrix for 
    polynomial distributed lags, and "disaggregate" - disaggregates 
    a vector or time series from low to high frequency.

2004-09-21 fBasics: BasicStatistics
    All column and row statistics functions now allow for 'timeSeries' 
    objects and any other 'rectangular' objects which can be transformed 
    to a matrix as input.
    
2004-09-19 fSeries: RollingAnalysis
    All rolling anslysis functions now allow for univariate 'timeSeries' 
    objects and  any other objects which can be transformed to a vector 
    as input.
    
2004-09-19 fSeries: TseriesTests
    All test functions now allow for univariate 'timeSeries' objects and 
    any other objects which can be transformed to a vector as input.
    
2004-09-19 fBasics: DistributionFits
    All fitting functions now allow for univariate 'timeSeries' objects 
    and any other objects which can be transformed to a vector as input.
    
2004-09-19 fBasics: StylizedFacts
    All stylized facts functions now allow for univariate 'timeSeries' 
    objects and any other objects which can be transformed to a vector 
    as input.
    
2004-09-19 fBasics: ClassicalTests
    All test functions now allow for univariate 'timeSeries' objects and 
    any other objects which can be transformed to a vector as input.

2004-09-18 fOptions: EBMDistributions, GammaFunctions, HypergeometricFunctions
    Three new Chapters have been introduced with functions to compute
    distributions, the error, gamma and related functions, and the 
    confluent hypergeometric functions. These functions are useful in the
    field of Exponential Brownian Motion and for the valuation of 
    Asian Options. The demo file "demo/funOptions.R" where the functions 
    where originally listed is now obsolete.

2004-09-14 fSeries: UnitrootDistribution
    Two functions to compute the cumulative probability, punitroot, 
    and the quantiles, qunitroot, of the unit root test statistics 
    have been added. The functions are based on the Fortran routine 
    and the tables published by J.G. McKinnon 1988.
    
2004-09-10 fSeries: black.ts.csv
    A data file which contains real monthly stock return data from January  
    1978 to December 1987 which are constructed from Berndt's (1991) 
    data set have been added.
    
2004-09-10 fSeries: LongMemoryModelling
    Functions to simulate the long memory behaviour of an univariate 
    time series process have been added. Inclided are Beran's, 
    Durbin's, and Paxson's method to generate Fractional Gaussian
    Noise.

2004-09-08 fSeries: klein.csv
    A data file which contains data for Klein's (1950) simple econometric 
    model of the US economy has been added.
    
2004-09-08 fSeries: xmpZWChapter03
    Demo files with examples from Chapter 3 of the book of Zivot and
    Wang "Modeling Financial Time Series with Splus" have been added.

2004-09-03 fSeries: RollingAnalysis
    Caused by a typing error the function 'rollMean' failed when the 
    argument 'trim' was set to FALSE. This has been corrected.

2004-09-03 fSeries: EquationsModelling
    We have added functions to perform fits of systems of regression 
    equations. The underlying functions are those from the contributed 
    R-package 'systemfit' written by Jeff D. Hamann and Arne Henningsen.
    'systemfit' offers functions for fitting linear structural equations 
    using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Weighted Least Squares (WLS), 
    Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR), Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS), 
    Weighted Two-Stage Least Squares (W2SLS) or Three-Stage Least 
    Squares (3SLS). The wrapper fullfills the naming conventions of 
    Rmetrics, returns a S4 objects, and allows for 'timeSeries' objects 
    as input. In addition a S-Plus like Finmetrics function 'SUR' is 
    made available. 
    
2004-09-03 fSeries: xmpEqnsGreenfeld
    An example to estimate Grunfeld's Model Data with OLS and SUR was
    added. Different stock prices often move in the same direction at 
    a given point in time. The SUR technique may provide more efficient 
    estimates than OLS in this situation. The example was used by Zellner 
    in his classic. 1962 paper on seemingly unrelated regressions. 
   
2004-09-03 fSeries: kmenta.csv
    A data file which contains partly contrived data from Kmenta (1986) has
    been added, constructed to illustrate estimation of a simultaneous 
    equation models.
    
2004-09-02 fBasics: HolidayCalendars 
    The function 'fjulian' got a new argument 'swap' making the old
    one 'cc' obsolute. This change was inspired by the POSIX standard.
    'swap' is an integer value which determines when dates without
    the century specifications swap from the 19th to 20th century,
    by default the value is 20, i.e. we swap 1920.

2004-09-02 fBasics: WebImport
    A new function named 'fredImport' has been added which allows for 
    downloading daily financial market data from the St. Louis FED.
    The import functions got a new argument 'sep' which allows to
    specify the field separator in the data file, usually an Excel
    *.csv file. The default is a semicolon.

2004-08-05 fSeries: DESCRIPTION
    The package 'modreg' has been merged into 'stats', so we have
    removed it from the dependency list in the description file.
    This caused for Mac OSX operated system a failure.

2004-08-05 fSeries: surex1.ts.csv
    A data file has been added which contains monthly sampled exchange 
    rate spot returns and forward premium data ranging from March 1976 to 
    June 1996 for the following currencies: USD vs. CAD, DEM, FFR, ITL,
    JPY and GBP.  

2004-07-07 fSeries: nelsonplosser.csv
    The Nelson-Plosser data set containing the fourteen US economic time
    series used by Nelson and Plosser in their seminal paper has been added.
    
2004-07-07 fSeries: xmpAparchModelling
    The four demos "xmpAparchInnovations", "xmpAparchSimulation",
    "xmpAparchEstimation", and "xmpAparchNYSERES" have been merged
    to one new demo named "xmpAparchModelling" to reduce a little bit 
    the large number of example files.
    
2004-07-07 fSeries: xmpArmaModelling
    The two demos "xmpArmaAnalysis", and "xmpArmaModelling", have been
    merged to one new demo named "xmpArmaModelling" to reduce a little
    bit the large number of example files.
    
2004-07-07 fBasics: xmpImportInternet
    The three demos "xmpImportYahoo", "xmpImportEconomagics", and
    "xmpImportForecasts"  have been merged to one new demo named 
    "xmpImportInternet" to reduce a little bit the large number of 
    example files.
 
2004-07-07 fBasics: xmpXtsBusinessTime
    The four demos "xmpXtsDailyWeeklyHists", "xmpXtsInterpolation",
    "xmpXtsDeSeasonalization", and "xmpXtsDeVolatilization" have been
    merged to one new demo named "xmpXtsBusinessTime" to reduce a
    little bit the large number of example files.

    All "*Fit" functions which the parameter estimation functions 
    from the "evir" and "ismev" packages have now a common print, 
    plot and summary S3 method which deliver their output in the 
    same form.
        
2004-03-21 fExtremes
    A new function "interactivePlot" was added which allows for 
    plots in different ways by an argument named "which". If which 
    is a character string named "all" all plots are created, if 
    which is a logical vector of the length of the number of plots, 
    those plots are created which elements of this vector set "TRUE", 
    or if which a a character string named named "ask" the plots 
    interact with their user.
        
2004-02-14 fOptions
    New functions have been added for the valuation of options 
    by Monte Carlo simulations. These are: "wienerPath",
